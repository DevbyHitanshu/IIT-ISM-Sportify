Sportify
We wish to create an Application for Sports players /any fitness enthusiast to help them exercise any time and anywhere. The end product is an android mobile application using which helps athletes for overall accurate workout posture correction, helps in physiotherapy in case of injury, and provides athletes with a virtual environment for motivation and a more indulging experience. The idea is divided into two parts: 
(Posture correction with 3d mapping of the body) 
(Connected platform with a VR environment). 
For 3d body mapping, the Phone's camera would be used hence accessible anytime. Similarly, the Application would be used for experiencing the user with Virtual environment.
